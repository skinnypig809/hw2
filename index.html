        <h1>Redesign Jahunger</h1>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h1>Part 1:</h1>
    
        <p>This page demonstrate the process of improving this webpage: <a href="https://www.jahunger.com">jahunger's ordering page</a>. The reason I chose this website is that I used this website for few times as a user and felt like it could be improved.</p>
        <h3>Screenshots of this website:</h3>
        <div class="image-container">

      </div>
      <h3>Here are some problems I found with this website:</h3>
      <p>1.	The submenu on the top "store, location, contact us" is not obvious to see and people usually ignore them if not looking carefully.</p>
      <p>2.	The submenu for choosing appetizers and entree should always appear in the page so we don't need to scroll all the way up to switch.</p>
      <p>3.	The search button is not obvious and lack of description.</p>
      <p>4.	The functionality of "Buy Now" button is adding 1 item to shopping cart, what about adding three cups of cokes? It's annoying to go back and click again</p>
      <p>5.	The banner image is really large and unnessesery. Especially for mobile users, they need to scroll all the way to the bottom every time when they open up this page</p>
      <p>6.	The featured products section only has gift cards which can be dealt with better</p>
      <p>7.	The menu seems a little bit too spread out</p>
      <h3>Here are some problems WebAIM WAVE found:</h3>
      <p>1.	Some empty links </p>
      <p>2.	Contrast issues </p>
      <p>3.	When selecting item, it has redundant link issues because the texts and images are going to the same pages </p>
      <p>I think the first two suggestions are good but the third one is not. Because diffrent users has different habits where some of them tend to click text and others tend to click the images. Setting links for both of them is a reasonablt approch. </p>

      <h1>Part 2:</h1>
      <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>
      <p>I tried to combine everything into just one page to avoid lots of scrolling. The whole thing now looks more focused on the dishes instead of leaving lots of empty space and unnessesery images. </p>
